ETL PROJECT - World Population- World sucide

Why do we care about suicide? This has to be the most depressing dataset to examine. According to Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, Global Burden of Disease 2010, the 
suicide became the leading cause of death in 2010 for people ages 15-49 in the developed world in 2010. More recently, there has been more of a shift towards prevention.

We chose the two datasets because one gave the increases in population and the numer of sicides and the country gdp. This sets up a 
database for suicide, population, and gdp by country.

World population data. 
We extracted the population data from the csv file to pandas dataframe. We transformed the 
world population data by renaming columns. We cleaned by dropping NAs and --, which had been replaced by NA.

We created a mysql database with the population table. We connected to the mysql database using the mysql.db.

Out of the data, we selected a ten years for this specific database.
We created a country code based on the first three characters of the country name.
We renamed the columns to match the database columns.

We populated the data in the database in the additional suicide table. It is now ready for JOINS or aggregations.
